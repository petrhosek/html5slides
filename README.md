A Google HTML5 slide template
=============================

By Luke Mahé and Marcin Wichary.

Instructions for editing slides
-------------------------------

Get this [template](https://github.com/petrh/html5slides/raw/master/template/index.html) and copy/paste it to a new file on your local computer.

Edit at will. Copy the code for the sample slides and fill it out with the content you want.

If you need styles for different tags or different types of slides, please let us know.

Different themes
----------------

Change the class **template-default** on *section class="slides"* to use a different template:

* **template-default** = default Google template
* **template-io2011** = I/O 2011 template

Different layouts
-----------------

Change the outermost section class **layout-regular** to **layout-faux-widescreen** or **layout-widescreen**.

Instructions for presenting
---------------------------

Press Enter, space, right arrow to advance; Backspace, left arrow to go back.

Enter full-screen mode (F11 or Shift-Command-F) before presenting.

You should be able to press Ctrl+R/F5 at any time to refresh without losing your place in the presentation.

If an iframe steals your focus and you can’t advance any more, please click outside the slide on the background to give the focus back to the presentation.

Caveats
-------

Should work on modern Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and generally touch devices.
